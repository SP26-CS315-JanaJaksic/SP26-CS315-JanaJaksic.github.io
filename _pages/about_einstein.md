I am a Computer Science undergraduate student at Oakland City University with a minor in Business Administration. I am interested in building practical, well-structured solutions while developing skills relevant to business technology, project coordination, and technology-driven decision making. I enjoy learning how technical systems support business goals and how clear communication and collaboration contribute to successful outcomes.I am self-motivated, detail-oriented, and committed to writing clean, efficient code while continuously improving my technical and professional skills.. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
