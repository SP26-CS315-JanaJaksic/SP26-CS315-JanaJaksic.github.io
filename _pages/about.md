I am a Computer Science undergraduate student at Oakland City University with a minor in Business Administration. I am interested in building practical, well-structured solutions while developing skills relevant to business technology, project coordination, and technology-driven decision making. I enjoy learning how technical systems support business goals and how clear communication and collaboration contribute to successful outcomes.I am self-motivated, detail-oriented, and committed to writing clean, efficient code while continuously improving my technical and professional skills.
